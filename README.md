# Creation Background
This was a piece of work completed for my A-level NEA throughout 2022. This was completed prior to my knowledge of how to effectively use git, file seperation, and secure dynamic file management. Outside of the README, further additions (even simple/easy/obvious ones) have not been made, in order to preserve the integrity of the project in its original final form.

# Aimed objective
The purpose of this program, was to allow a set of lines to be drawn onto a canvas, with these lines being converted into graphs - enabling a select number of algorithms to be optionally run on them. 

# How to use
- Run the file Alevel_NEA.py in order to access the program
- Creating an account with a unsername and password is necessary for further functionality
- Follow insturctions, buttons and popups to navigate the system
## Details
- One must "make graph", essentially defining nodes and edges for the set of drawn lines, before being able to save/run algorithms
## Quirks
- To quit the program, this should be done manually, unable to do this by simply closing the window
- Closing windows can sometimes produce unexpected behaviours
- Undo/Redo features may not work everywhere as expected.
- Login files are saved to the repo directory itself, rather than (somewhere else) a users local machine; and while passwords are hashed, the files aren't.
## Notes
- Excessive amount of lines, and abuse of the system can potentially cause it to crash when attempting to "make graph"
- The current user files are simply legacy from testing (feel free to delete them on any copies)
